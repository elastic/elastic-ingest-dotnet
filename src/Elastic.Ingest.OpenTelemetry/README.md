# Elastic.Ingest.OpenTelemetry

A `Elastic.Channel` implementation of `BufferedChannelBase` that allows OpenTelemetry data to be written over OTLP.

This is not currently published to NuGet with no current plans to ever do so.

This project currently only exists as a proof of concept to validate the concepts of `Elastic.Channels`
